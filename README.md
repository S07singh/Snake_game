# 🐍 Snake Game in C++

A simple console-based **Snake Game** built using **C++**. This project simulates the classic snake game, where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## 🔥 Features
- **Game Controls**: Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.
- **Snake Growth**: The snake grows each time it eats the food.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
- **Score**: The score increases as the snake eats food and grows longer.
- **Console Graphics**: Simple text-based graphics in the console.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `conio.h` for console input (e.g., _getch() function for key presses).
  - `windows.h` for handling console screen refreshing (e.g., `Sleep()` function).
